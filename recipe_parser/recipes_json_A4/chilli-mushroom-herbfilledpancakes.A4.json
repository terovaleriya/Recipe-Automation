         "step": "1. Soak the shiitake mushrooms in 75ml boiling water for 10 minutes. Make the pancake batter by combining the rice flour, cornflour, coconut milk powder and turmeric. Slowly whisk in 140ml water to make a smooth batter. Set aside.\n\n2. Meanwhile, heat ½ tbsp oil in a 20cm frying pan over a high heat and fry the fresh mushrooms for 5-6 minutes, until browned. Drain and roughly chop the shiitake mushrooms (reserving any liquid) and add to the pan with the white parts of the salad onions and any reserved liquid. Fry for a minute. \n\n3. Set half the mixture aside then return the pan to the heat. Reduce the heat slightly, then spread the mixture evenly in the pan before adding another ½ tbsp oil, followed by half the batter. Fry for 1-1½ minutes then scatter with half the salad onions and half the beansprouts. Cover with a lid and steam for another 2 minutes or until piping hot. Remove to a plate, scatter with half the herbs, and fold in half. Repeat with the remaining mushrooms, ½ tbsp oil and crêpe batter. Serve with sweet chilli sauce."
