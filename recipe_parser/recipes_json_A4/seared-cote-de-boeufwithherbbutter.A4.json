Scrape onto baking parchment, then roll into a sausage shape, twisting the parchment to secure each end and place in the fridge overnight.\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 200°C, gas mark 6 and heat a griddle pan until hot. Sear the beef for 2 minutes on both sides then transfer to a tray. Top the beef with 2 slices of the cold herbed butter, then cook in the oven for 16 minutes for rare, 20 minutes for medium. Place 2 more discs of butter on top of the beef for the last 5 minutes of cooking.\n\n3. Remove from the oven, top with extra butter (optional), season and leave to rest for at least 10 minutes. Slice thickly and serve with skinny fries, if desired."
