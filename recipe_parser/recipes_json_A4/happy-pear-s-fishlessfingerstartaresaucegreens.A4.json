      {
         "step": "1. Cover the cashew nuts with boiling water and leave to soak. Meanwhile, mix the tartare sauce ingredients together, cover and chill \nuntil needed.\n\n2. To make the fishless fingers, press the firm tofu to remove excess moisture. Drain the cashews, then pulse with the tofu, chick peas, garlic granules, seaweed and ½ tsp salt in a food processor until smooth but still with a little texture. Shape into 10 fingers (about 50g each), or 12 smaller ones, and set aside. \n\n3. Using a fork, mix the flaxseed with 180ml cold water to make ‘flax egg’. Set aside to thicken. Put the gram flour on a large plate. Transfer the thickened flax egg to another large plate. Mix the breadcrumbs, turmeric and paprika and remaining salt together on a third plate.\n\n4. Dip the fishless fingers in the flour to cover completely, then into the flax egg and finally into the breadcrumbs until evenly coated. Heat a nonstick frying pan over a high heat. Add 2 tbsp of sunflower or vegetable oil, reduce to a medium heat and cook the fingers in batches for 5-6 minutes until golden, turning occasionally. Add more oil as needed. Set aside on kitchen paper and keep warm. Return the pan to the heat, add the spinach, olive oil and a pinch of salt. Leave to wilt for 2-3 minutes. Serve immediately with the fishless fingers and tartare sauce."
