  "instructions": [
    {
      "step": "1. Put the wings and giblets in a large pan with 1.5L cold water. Bring to the boil over a high heat. Skim off any froth from the surface. Add the onion, carrots, celery, bouquet garni, parsley, peppercorns and salt. Bring back to the boil then cover and simmer for 2 hours.\n\n2. Strain the stock into a large measuring jug (you should have about 1L). After roasting your turkey, pour as much fat as possible from the turkey tin into a separate jug, leaving behind the meat juices. Put the tin over a low heat and add the sherry, scraping up any bits from the bottom with a wooden spoon. Let the alcohol cook off for a couple of minutes, then remove from the heat.\n\n3. Scoop about 4 tbsp turkey fat into a saucepan and beat in the flour. Cook over a low heat for 2 minutes, then add the stock gradually, making sure it’s incorporated before adding more. Once all the stock has been poured in, add the juices from the turkey tin and the pomegranate molasses. \n\n4. Cook the gravy over a low heat for 20-30 minutes until it has thickened to your preferred consistency. Season, if needed, then serve."
