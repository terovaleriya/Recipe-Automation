To cook the lobster, bring a sautÃ© pan of water to the boil, add the tails and cook for 5 minutes. Remove and plunge into a bowl of iced water until cold. Check the lobster tails are cooked: the shell should go from a blue/pink colour to bright red and the meat from translucent to white and opaque."}, {"step": "2.

Heat a large sautÃ© pan, add the olive oil and gently warm with the garlic and chilli until the garlic starts to turn golden but doesnât burn.
