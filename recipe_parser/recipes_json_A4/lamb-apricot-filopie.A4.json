Preheat the oven to 200°C, gas mark 6. Warm the oil in a deep 22cm ovenproof frying pan or shallow casserole over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 4-5 minutes. Increase the heat and cook the courgette and peppers for 2 minutes. Set aside in a bowl. Return the pan to the heat and add the lamb. Stir fry for 4 minutes over a high heat until browned. Reduce the heat slightly. Add the garlic, spices and spinach, in 3 batches, until wilted. Add to the vegetables, together with the apricots. Season."}, {"step": "2. Remove the frying pan from the heat, wipe clean and spray with a little oil. Lay a sheet of filo pastry into the base, with one end in the centre, and the rest overhanging the edge. Spritz with a couple of sprays of sunflower oil and then repeat with the remaining filo sheets, overlapping slightly, to cover the base completely. Tip the lamb and vegetables on top, then fold the pastry sheets over the topping, working around the pan, until enclosed â spritz with oil between layers."}, {"step": "3. Return the pan to a high heat and fry the base of the pie for 3-4 minutes, then put the pan into the oven and cook for 15 minutes until golden and crisp. Slice and serve straight away."}, {"step": "Cookâs tip Try soaking leftover large soft apricots in warm orange juice, Earl Grey tea or even a spirit, such as brandy or sherry. They will absorb lots of flavour and are delicious as an easy storecupboard pudding with spoonfuls of Greek yogurt, crÃ¨me fraÃ®che, cream or ice cream. Also delicious with muesli for breakfast."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,491kJ 356kcals", "Fat": "13g", "Saturated Fat": "5.6g", "Carbohydrate": "39g", "Sugars": "13g", "Protein": "17g", "Salt": "0.4g", "Fibre": "6.8g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/l/Waitrose-Weekend_WK481_Healthy-Everyday_Lamb-Apricot-Filo-Pie.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
