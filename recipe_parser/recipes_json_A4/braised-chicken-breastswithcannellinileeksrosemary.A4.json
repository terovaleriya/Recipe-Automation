Bring to a simmer, then nestle the chicken breasts back into the pan. Transfer to the oven for 15-20 minutes or until the chicken is completely cooked through, the juices run clear and there is no pink meat."}, {"step": "3.

Season with a little black pepper and serve."}, {"step": "Cookâs tip Swap the cannellini beans for haricot or butter beans. Both work just as well and if you havenât got any chicken, how about trying this recipe with pork chops, or even salmon or firm white fish fillets? Just adjust the cooking time according to pack instructions, or until thoroughly cooked through and opaque."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,708kJ 407kcals", "Fat": "15g", "Saturated Fat": "4.2g", "Carbohydrate": "20g", "Sugars": "5.5g", "Protein": "43g", "Salt": "1.4g", "Fibre": "7.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/b/Waitrose-Weekend_Wk499_Healthy-Everyday_Chicken-Breast-Cannellini-Leeks-Rosemary.gif/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
