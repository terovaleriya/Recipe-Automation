Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the shallot gently for 5 minutes until soft. Stir in the curry powder and cook for a minute, then stir in the mango chutney and 2 tbsp water, stirring to combine. Take off the heat and cool for a minute, then stir through the yogurt."}, {"step": "2. Meanwhile, heat the rice according to the pack instructions. Roughly shred the cooked chicken breast with your fingers, then toss in a bowl with the rice, sugar snaps and parsley. Divide between 2 plates, top with the warm dressing and scatter with pistachios."}, {"step": "Cookâs tip For a meat-free version, try swapping the chicken breast for flaked hot smoked salmon. Some cooked broad beans or peas would work well tossed through the rice, too. Or canned, drained chickpeas, lentils or other beans. Try adding them with the curry powder in step 1 for some extra flavour."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,023kJ 480kcals", "Fat": "13g", "Saturated Fat": "2.5", "Carbohydrate": "40g", "Sugars": "9.4g", "Protein": "48g", "Salt": "0.4g", "Fibre": "6.4g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/Waitrose-Weekend_Wk498_Healthy-Everyday_Coronation-Style-Chicken-Sugar-Snap-Wild-Rice.gif/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
