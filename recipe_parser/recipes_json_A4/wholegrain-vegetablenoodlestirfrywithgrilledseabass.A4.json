Meanwhile, warm the vegetable oil in a wok over a high heat. Add the red onion and garlic and stir fry for 1 minute, then add the pepper and stir fry for another minute before adding the kale. \n\n3. After stir frying for 1-2 minutes, toss in the vermicelli and soy sauce to combine and heat through. Serve piping hot with the fish, garnished with the salad onions, and lime wedges on the side for squeezing over."
