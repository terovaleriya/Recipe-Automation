      {
         "step": "1. Peel and finely chop the onion, garlic and ginger. Deseed and chop the red peppers and the pumpkin into bitesize pieces (we like to leave the skin on pumpkins and sweet potatoes because lots of the fibre is in the skin. We do peel butternut squash as the skin can be bitter).\n\n2. Warm the oil in a large pan over a high heat. Fry the onion, garlic and ginger for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the onions are starting to brown and the garlic is turning golden. Mix in the pumpkin/squash/sweet potato with the peppers and season with salt. Cover, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. \n\n3. Stir in the tomatoes, red lentils, stock, curry powder and the black pepper. Turn the heat up high and bring to the boil with the lid on. Reduce to a simmer and cook for about 20 minutes until the lentils and pumpkin are soft. Stir regularly so the lentils don’t stick to the the pan. Season to taste.\n\n4. Remove from the heat and stir in the spinach (or other greens) before serving. Enjoy with a nice chunk of bread."
