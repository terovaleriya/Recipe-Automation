Meanwhile, in a medium-sized bowl, stir together the grated squash, lime pickle, green chilli, curry powder, lime zest and juice, coconut and chickpea flour until a thick batter forms."}, {"step": "3. Once the oil is up to temperature (if you donât have a thermometer to check the oil, drop in a small amount of batter. It should sizzle on contact with the oil and take around 30 seconds to colour), carefully drop teaspoon-sized portions of the batter into the oil. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until golden, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper to absorb any excess oil. Keep adjusting the temperature as you fry, so the oil doesnât get too hot."}, {"step": "4. Continue to fry the pakoras until all the batter is used up. Serve warm with natural yogurt and extra lime pickle"}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "306kJ 74kcals", "Fat": "5.6g", "Saturated Fat": "2.2g", "Carbohydrate": "3.5g", "Sugars": "1.4g", "Protein": "1.7g", "Salt": "0.1g", "Fibre": "1.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/Waitrose-Weekend_Wk475_Martha-Seasonal-Recipes_Curried-Squash-Lime-&-Coconut-Pakora.gif/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
