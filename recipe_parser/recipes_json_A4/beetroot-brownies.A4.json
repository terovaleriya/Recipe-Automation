Heat the oven to 180 ÌC, gas mark 4. Grease and line a 20cm x 30cm baking tin with baking parchment. Boil the beetroot in a pan of water until very soft and tender â about 1 hour. Drain well and, once cool enough to handle, rub off the skin. Whizz in a food processor, scraping down the sides as needed, until you have a coarse pureÌe. Reserve 1 tbsp pureÌe for the icing."}, {"step": "2. Melt 200g chocolate with the butter in a large heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water; remove from the heat and set aside. Whisk the eggs, granulated sugar, vanilla and salt in another bowl, then beat into the chocolate mixture and stir in the beetroot pureÌe. Sift in the flour and cocoa, add the remaining 100g chocolate chunks and fold everything in until just combined."}, {"step": "3. Pour into the tin and bake for 35-40 minutes, until a crust has formed; cool completely in the tin. Before serving, beat the reserved beetroot pureÌe with the icing sugar (loosen with a few drops of water, if needed) to drizzle over the top."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,427kJ 341kcals", "Fat": "17.7g", "Saturated Fat": "10.4g", "Carbohydrate": "40.1g", "Sugars": "32.6g", "Protein": "5.3g", "Salt": "0.6g", "Fibre": "1.9g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/b/beetroot Brownie.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
