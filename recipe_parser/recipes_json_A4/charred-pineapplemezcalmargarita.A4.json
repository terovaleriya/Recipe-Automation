Start by making the pineapple syrup. Cut the pineapple into 1cm thick slices and trim off the skin. Heat a large frying pan over a high heat and place the pineapple slices into the hot, dry pan. You may need to do this in batches. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side until lightly charred. Remove from the pan and leave to cool. Blitz the charred slices in a blender until totally smooth. 2. Add 250ml of blended pineapple, the sugar and 250ml water to a small saucepan. Stir and bring to a rolling boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring regularly. Cool and strain into a lidded container. Refrigerate until needed. 3. For the margarita (to make two, you can double the recipe), put all the ingredients into a cocktail shaker with plenty of ice, cover and shake vigorously for 10 seconds. Strain into a salt-rimmed tumbler (run a lime wedge around the top of the glass and press into a saucer of salt) containing more ice and garnish with a pineapple leaf."}], "nutrition": null, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/Charred-Pineapple-Mezcal-Margarita.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
