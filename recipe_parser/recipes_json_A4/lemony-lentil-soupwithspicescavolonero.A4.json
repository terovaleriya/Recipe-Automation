         "step": "1. Add the lentils to a large saucepan with the onion, turmeric, chopped garlic, and half of the chilli flakes and cumin. Add 900ml cold water, bring to the boil then simmer, covered with a lid just ajar to prevent the pan from boiling over, for 15 minutes until the lentils are almost tender.\n\n2. Stir in the cubed potato, plus two strips of pared lemon zest (do this with a vegetable peeler. You’ll need 4-5 strips in total) and ½ tsp salt. Add another 300ml water, then simmer for 15-20 minutes until the potato is tender. The soup should be fairly loose. \n\n3. Stir in the cavolo nero, simmer for 3 minutes or until just wilted, then season with the juice of half a lemon and salt and pepper – it’s likely you’ll need another good pinch of salt to round out the flavours. \n\n4. Heat the oil in a small pan, add the sliced garlic, remaining chilli flakes and cumin seeds plus a couple more strips of lemon zest. Sizzle gently for 2 minutes, until the garlic is golden, the seeds toasted and the oil reddish in colour from the chillies. Drizzle a little over the soup, and finish with the coriander. Serve with the remaining lemon in wedges for squeezing over."
