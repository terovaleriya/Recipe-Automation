      "step": "1. In a large saucepan, warm the butter and both sugars until the butter has melted. Stir to combine, then remove from the heat and cool for \n5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, combine the raisins, flour, oats, bicarbonate of soda, salt and cinnamon. \n\n2. Using a wooden spoon, beat the egg into the butter and sugar in the saucepan, then tip in the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Chill for at least 1 hour. \n\n3. Preheat the oven to 180°C, gas mark 4. Line two large baking sheets with baking parchment. Divide the mixture into 12 large spoonfuls (about 60-65g each) and roll each into a ball with your hands. Place in two batches of six, spacing well apart on the parchment and flattening the balls slightly as you arrange them. \n\n4. Bake for 16-18 minutes (turning and swapping the baking sheets halfway if they brown more on one side than the other) until spread and golden. Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then use a spatula to transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve at room temperature, or store in an airtight container for up to three days."
