Preheat the oven to 190ËC, gas mark 5. Drop the shallots into the bottom of a roasting tin. Very lightly score the lamb through the fat. Lay the lamb fat-side down on top of the shallots and rub ½ the salt and seaweed flakes onto one side of it. Season with ground black pepper. Turn the lamb over and repeat. Pour the white wine into the roasting tray around the lamb and add the juniper berries, then seal the tray with a double layer of tin foil and roast for 2 hours, or until the meat is totally tender to the point of a knife."}, {"step": "2. Turn the oven off and heat the grill to high (or turn the oven up to high if you donât have a big enough grill). Strain the meat juices through a sieve into a small saucepan. Spoon off any excess fat (see tip below). Grill the meat fat-side up until browned and crisp (about 15-20 minutes). Lift the lamb onto a plate or board to rest for 10 minutes before carving. Meanwhile, boil the juices, reducing until strong and rich, then season. Serve the lamb with the jus, plus some boiled potatoes coated in butter and parsley and seasonal vegetables, if liked."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per serving (6) 2030kJ 488kcals", "Fat": "30g", "Saturated Fat": "14g", "Carbohydrate": "1.5g", "Sugars": "1.2g", "Protein": "40g", "Salt": "2.3g", "Fibre": "5.6g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/l/Lamb-with-seaweed.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
