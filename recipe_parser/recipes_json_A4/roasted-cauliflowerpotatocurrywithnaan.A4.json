         "step": "1. Preheat the oven to 200ºC, gas mark 6, and line the baking tray with parchment. Break the cauliflower into florets, reserving any unblemished leaves. Add 1 tsp of coconut oil to the florets on the tray, toss together and roast for 15 minutes. Shred the reserved leaves and add to one side of the tray, so they stay separate from the florets. Return to the oven for a further 10 minutes. \n\n2. Meanwhile, boil the potatoes for 15 minutes. Drain. Add the remaining ½ tbsp coconut oil to a large hot saucepan, then fry the onion for 2 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook until soft. Season with salt, add the curry paste, then stir in the coconut milk and simmer gently for 5 minutes, adding about 100ml of boiling water to loosen. Add the hot potatoes and cauliflower florets and simmer for 7 minutes.\n\n3. Heat the naan bread according to pack instructions. Serve with the curry, garnished with the roasted cauliflower leaves and some coriander."
