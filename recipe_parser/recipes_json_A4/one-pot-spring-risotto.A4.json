    {
      "step": "1. Start by toasting the pine nuts in a large pan with a lid until lightly golden, then set to one side.\n\n2. Heat the oil in the same pan, and add the onion and a large pinch of sea salt. Put on the lid and fry gently for 2-3 minutes until transparent. Add the garlic, stir to combine and add the orzo. Stir together well and replace the lid. Fry for 2 minutes. Mix the bouillon powder with 1 litre of boiling water, then add to the pan, stir well and bring to the boil. Cover again, reduce the heat and cook for about 5 minutes, until the orzo has absorbed most of the liquid. Add the frozen petits pois, stir well, replace the lid and cook for 3 minutes. Then stir in the spinach, which will wilt in the heat.\n\n3. Taste a piece of orzo to check it is cooked. It should be al dente. If the orzotto needs to be loosened up a bit, add a splash more boiling water until itâ€™s as wet as you like it.\n\n4. Remove from the heat and add most of the chopped dill, half the toasted pine nuts and half the feta. Fold these through gently and taste for seasoning. Plenty of black pepper will be good, but it might not need any more salt, due to the stock and the feta. Add a little grated nutmeg if you have some to hand. Divide between bowls and serve with the rest of the feta crumbled over, garnished with the remaining pine nuts and dill."
