Heat the oil in a casserole dish or sauté pan over a medium heat. Add the chorizo and fry for 2 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove to a plate with a slotted spoon and leave the oil in the pan. \n\n2. Add the onion, celery and peppers and cook for 5-7 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and Cajun seasoning.  Cook for 30 seconds before adding the rice, passata and stock. Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally so the base doesn’t stick.\n\n3. Stir the chorizo back into the pan with the prawns and cook for another 4-5 minutes until piping hot and the rice is tender. Divide between 4 plates and scatter with the parsley."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,171kJ 516kcals", "Fat": "14g", "Saturated Fat": "4.4g", "Carbohydrate": "59g", "Sugars": "13g", "Protein": "35g", "Salt": "1.8g", "Fibre": "7.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Prawn-&-Chorizo-Jambalaya_215822.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
