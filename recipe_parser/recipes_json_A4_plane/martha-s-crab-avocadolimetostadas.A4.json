Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Cut the tortilla wraps into quarters and toast in the pan for a minute on each side. They should just begin to brown and will crisp up as they cool. Set aside.\n\n2. Dress the crab by placing the meat into a small bowl and adding the zest and juice of one lime, half the chilli (to taste) and the coriander. Peel the avocado and remove the stone. Slice half into cubes. Add to the crab mixture, stir to combine and season to taste.\n\n3. Combine the mayonnaise with the juice of half a lime and slice the remaining lime into wedges.\n\n4. Spread a little lime mayonnaise onto each tostada and top with a spoonful of dressed crab. Finely slice the remaining avocado and use to garnish along with the lime wedge and a few pieces of chilli.
